    Abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased.  Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.  The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with  ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.}

abstract={Bioinformatics tools require large-scale processing mainly due to very large databases achieving gigabytes of size. In federated cloud environments, although services and resources may be shared, storage is particularly difficult, due to distinct computational capabilities and data management policies of several separated clouds. In this work, we propose a storage policy for BioNimbuZ, a hybrid federated cloud platform designed to execute bioinformatics applications. Our storage policy, BioClouZ, aims to perform efficient choices to distribute and replicate files to the best available cloud resources in the federation in order to reduce computational time. BioClouZ uses four parameters - latency, uptime, free size and cost, weighted (according to ad hoc tests) to model their influences to data storage and recovery. Experiments were performed with real biological data executing a commonly used tool to map short reads in a reference genome in BioNimbuZ, composed of clouds executing in Amazon EC2, Azure and University of Brasilia. The results showed that, when compared to the greedy algorithm first used in BioNimbuZ, the BioClouZ policy significantly improved the total execution time due to more efficient choices of the clouds to store the files. Other bioinformatics applications can be used with BioClouZ in BioNimbuZ as well, since the platform was designed independently from particular tools and databases.},

abstract={Task scheduling in a federated cloud environment is a complex problem since there are several cloud providers presenting distinct memory and storage capacities that should be addressed. This article focus on the task scheduling problem in BioNimbuZ, a federated cloud infrastructure for executing bioinformatics applications, which was previously proposed by our group. We present a scheduling algorithm based on Load Balancing Ant Colony (LBACO), called ACOsched, to perform efficient distribution of tasks by finding the best cloud in the federation to execute these tasks. We developed experiments using real biological data, executing the Bowtie mapping tool on one instance of BioNimbuZ, composed by two cloud providers, Amazon EC2 and a bioinformatics laboratory at the University of Brasilia/Brazil. The obtained results show that ACOsched led to a significant improvement in the makespan time of Bowtie executing in BioNimbuZ, when compared to the simple round robin algorithm called DynamicAHP, previously developed in this federated cloud infrastrucutre.},

abstract={General purpose GPU Computing (GPGPU) has taken off in the past few years, with great promises for increased desktop processing power due to the large number of fast computing cores on high-end graphics cards. Many publications have demonstrated phenomenal performance and have reported speedups as much as 1000× over code running on multi-core CPUs. Other studies have claimed that well-tuned CPU code reduces the performance gap significantly. We demonstrate that this important discussion is missing a key aspect, specifically the question of where in the system data resides, and the overhead to move the data to where it will be used, and back again if necessary. We have benchmarked a broad set of GPU kernels on a number of platforms with different GPUs and our results show that when memory transfer times are included, it can easily take between 2 to 50× longer to run a kernel than the GPU processing time alone. Therefore, it is necessary to either include memory transfer overhead when reporting GPU performance, or to explain why this is not relevant for the application in question. We suggest a taxonomy for future CPU/GPU comparisons, and we argue that this is not only germane for reporting performance, but is important to heterogeneous scheduling research in general.},
