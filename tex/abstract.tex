The use of heterogeneous architectures is a reality in the cloud environment. However, it is still a feature not explored, especially in the federation environment computational clouds. This work proposes a task scheduler capable of scheduling cloud federations composed of machines with heterogeneous architectures. To validate the proposed scheduler the BioNimbuZ federated cloud platform was used. The proposed scheduler opens possibilities for new tasks to be executed in computational clouds in a viable way.
