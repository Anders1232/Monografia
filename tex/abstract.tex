The use of heterogeneous architectures is a reality in the cloud environment. However, it is still a feature not explored, especially in the federation environment computational clouds. This work proposes a heterogeneous scheduler of tasks capable of scheduling for BioNimbuZ, a platform for federation of computational clouds developed at the Laboratório de Bioinforática e Dados (LABID) of Universidade of Brasília, of which this author is a part. The proposed scheduler opens possibilities for new tasks to be executed in computational clouds in a viable way.
