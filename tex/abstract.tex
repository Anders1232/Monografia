The usage of heterogeneous architectures is a reality in the cloud environment. However, it is still a little exploited feature, especially in the federated cloud computing environment. This work proposes a job scheduler capable of scheduling cloud federations composed of machines with heterogeneous architectures. And it seeks to test the scheduler developed in the platform of federated clouds BioNimbuZ. The new scheduler opens up possibilities for new tasks to be executed in computational clouds in a viable way. In addition to having room for refinement of the scheduler itself.
